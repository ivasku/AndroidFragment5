# AndroidFragment5
TabLayout with Fragments


Fragment naviogation using TabLayout


We should use FragmentPagerAdapter if we don`t have too many pages, like 5 or 6, because it saves the instances of every Tab Fragment.


If we need many pages, we should use FragmentStatePagerAdapter, it will destroy the fragments as soon we switch to another Fragment.
